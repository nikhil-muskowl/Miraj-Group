        <b>"We are here to achieve excellence in business and excellence only comes through continuous practice thereby leading
            to the highest standards. I want the group to be regarded as one of the best managed and society oriented group.
            I and my team members are continuously striving and taking all possible steps to achieve every desired goal of
            our stakeholders, be it our customers, dealers, bankers and above all the great nation of ours, 'India'".</b>
        <br>
        <br> I struggled a lot for my aim and had to face many hurdles such as inadequate capital and material, inadequate infrastructure.
        In my life I got to meet less of reliable people and more of intelligent people. But I firmly kept by belief in the
        motto that "nothing bad can happen with you, if you are good with others without any motive. And almighty showered
        his blessings on me and Istarted a firm in name of "Miraj Zarda Udyog" in the year 1987. Initially all plant and
        machinery was developed in-house by myself.
        <br>
        <br> Life as everyone knows, is always taking exams and asking questions. I also got some hurdles but as after every
        night, there is clear day with bright sunshine, so I also got new opportunities after every problem. I met numerous
        persons along this path of life, many came and left, but there are some persons, who are my strength and they are
        still with me and will remain so.
